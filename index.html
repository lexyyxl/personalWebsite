                        <li>Highlight of the summer! I worked with three other students to make an online ramen cooking show for the class. Even with COVID-19 stopping us from meeting in person, we still made 10+ times of rehearsals through zoom calls. On our final presentation day, the clock counted down to zero right when my group finished our last line and we were voted #1 of all groups. That's the power of practice!</li>
                        <li>Wrote the script, guided other members to shoot, and edited the video.<a href="https://youtu.be/f_Ihvwvc7gU"> See our video here.</a></li>

                      <li>My first time playing with Linguistic Data and making data analysis with it.</li>
                      <li>Looked into Age of Word Acquisition; focused on the subjectivity and polarity of each word and the average age of acquiring it. A small conclusion: As our age increases, the proportion of sentimental words learned decreases in the process of word acquisition.<a href="assets/src/ling188.pdf"> See more here. </a></li>
                      <li>Looking back, some of the plots could definitely be made better looking, but it was still an interesting experience for me. This experience urged me to think about how to improve data visualization when we have a large amount of distinctive categories.</li>
